<h3>Remote health monitoring system</h3>

Overview:

The patients with critical health issues like heart attacks and other such problems have to be monitored constantly so that their lives are not at risk.

Goals: 

Remote patient health monitoring system solves the problem by monitoring the patient’s health using the modern technology.   

Working Methodology: 

Remote patient health monitoring system consists an Arduino microcontroller connected to various sensors and modules like temperature sensor, toxic gas sensor, ECG sensor, heartbeat sensor, humidity sensor, body movement sensor, alarm, GSM and GPS modules. Sensors monitor the patient and if there any causalities in their health, a text message and an email is sent to the guardian and the clinician or the doctor. All the details of the sensors is stored in a database which can be accessed in the webserver, Aadhaar card can also be linked so that accessing the information through the website becomes easier.  Hence the patient’s health can be monitored effectively and proper medication can be provided immediately.
